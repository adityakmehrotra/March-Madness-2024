# March-Madness-2024
Using Machine Learning to predict games in the 2024 March Madness Tournament.

## Data
I created a Python Web Scraper that scrapes `https://kenpom.com/` for all NCAA Men Statistics from 2002-2024.

## Code
I created a Random Forest Machine Learning algorithm in `ml_alog1.ipynb` to predict the outcome of several matchups saved in `predict.csv`.
